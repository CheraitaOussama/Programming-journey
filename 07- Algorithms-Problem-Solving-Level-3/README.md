# Algorithms & Problem Solving – Level 3
## Programming Advices – AbouHadhood Platform

This repository contains **50 solved algorithmic problems** from
**Algorithms & Problem Solving – Level 3** on the **AbouHadhood Platform**.

The goal of this level is to strengthen **logical thinking**, **problem
decomposition**, and writing **efficient and well-structured C++ code**.

---

## Course Overview

Level 3 introduces more challenging problem-solving tasks in the
Abu Hadhoud training series.

The main focus of this stage is solving **50 progressively difficult
algorithmic problems**, each designed to improve:

- Logical structuring
- Code efficiency
- Reusable function design

---

## Key Highlights

- Breaking down complex problems into clean, reusable functions,
  each with a single, well-defined responsibility
- Writing optimized solutions under practical constraints
- Gaining strong experience with debugging, edge cases, and performance
- Completing two hands-on projects that consolidate learning
  and produce real, practical code

---

## Technologies Used

- Language: C++
- Programming Paradigm: Structured Programming
- Tools:
  - VS Code / Dev-C++
  - Git
  - GitHub

---

## Next Steps

After completing this level, I advanced to
**Algorithms & Problem Solving – Level 4**,
which introduces more advanced problem sets and concepts.
