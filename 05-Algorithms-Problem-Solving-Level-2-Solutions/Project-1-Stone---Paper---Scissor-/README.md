# Stone – Paper – Scissors Game

## About the Project

A simple command-line game where the player competes against the computer
in the classic **Stone, Paper, Scissors** game.

The computer generates its choice randomly, and the program compares it
with the player's choice to determine the winner.

This project is part of the **AbouHadhood Platform** training track
with **Dr. Mohamed Abou Hadhoud** and is designed to practice core
programming fundamentals.
