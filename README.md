Algorithms & Problem Solving – Level 2
(Programming Advices – AbouHadhood Platform)

🎉 I’m happy to share that I’ve successfully completed Algorithms & Problem Solving – Level 2 on the
👉 AbouHadhood Platform

This repository contains solutions to algorithmic problems from Level 2, with a strong focus on problem decomposition and the Divide & Conquer approach.

🚀 Course Overview

This level focuses on:

Deepening understanding of algorithms & problem-solving strategies

Strengthening structured programming skills

Applying the Divide & Conquer principle in every solution

Each problem is broken down into small, focused functions and procedures, where every function has a single responsibility, resulting in:

Clean code

Readable logic

Reusable components

💡 Key Highlights

✅ Implementing core mathematical functions from scratch (without using the cmath library):

abs()

round()

floor()

ceil()

sqrt()

✅ Strong practice in:

Function decomposition

Logical thinking

Debugging techniques

Code optimization

✅ Two hands-on mini projects that combine all learned concepts

🛠 Technologies Used

Language: C++

Programming Paradigm: Structured Programming

Tools:

VS Code / Dev-C++

Git & GitHub

🔜 Next Steps

After completing Level 2, I moved on to
👉 Level 3 – Algorithms & Problem Solving,
which introduces more advanced challenges and complex problem-solving concepts.
