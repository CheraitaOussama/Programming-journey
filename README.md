📘 **05 - Algorithms & Problem Solving – Level 2 (Programming Advices)**  🎉 I’m happy to share that I’ve completed the **05 – Algorithms & Problem Solving Level 2** course on [AbouHadhood Platform](https://abouhadhood.com/) 🏆  This repository contains **algorithmic problems and solutions** from Level 2, focusing on deepening problem-solving skills while applying the **Divide & Conquer** approach.  ---  🚀 **Course Overview**  This phase was all about:  - Diving deeper into algorithms and problem-solving strategies. - Refining structured programming skills. - Staying true to the principle: **Divide & Conquer**.  We broke every problem into small, focused functions & procedures—each with a single responsibility—ensuring **clean, readable, and reusable code**.  ---  💡 **Key Highlights**  - **Implementing functions from scratch** instead of relying on built-in `cmath` library functions:   - `abs()`   - `round()`   - `floor()`   - `ceil()`   - `sqrt()` - Practicing **decomposition** and function design. - Strengthening **debugging** and **optimization** skills. - Wrapping up with two **hands-on projects** applying everything learned.  ---  🛠 **Technologies Used**  - **Language:** C++   - **Paradigm:** Structured Programming   - **Tools:** VS Code / Dev-C++, Git, GitHub    ---  🔜 **Next Steps**  After completing Level 2, I advanced to **Level 3 – Algorithms & Problem Solving**, which introduces more complex challenges and advanced concepts.
