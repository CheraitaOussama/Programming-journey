# Algorithms & Problem Solving – Level 2
## Programming Advices – AbouHadhood Platform

This repository contains solutions to **Algorithms & Problem Solving – Level 2**
from the **AbouHadhood Platform**:
https://abouhadhood.com/

The focus of this level is on strengthening problem-solving skills using
**Structured Programming** and the **Divide & Conquer** approach.

---

## Course Overview

This level focuses on:

- Deepening understanding of algorithms and problem-solving techniques
- Writing clean and structured C++ code
- Applying the Divide & Conquer principle in every problem

Each problem is decomposed into small functions and procedures,
where each function has a single responsibility.

---

## Key Highlights

- Implementing mathematical functions from scratch
  (without using the cmath library):
  - abs()
  - round()
  - floor()
  - ceil()
  - sqrt()

- Practicing:
  - Function decomposition
  - Logical thinking
  - Debugging
  - Code optimization

- Completing two hands-on projects that combine all learned concepts

---

## Technologies Used

- Language: C++
- Programming Paradigm: Structured Programming
- Tools:
  - VS Code / Dev-C++
  - Git
  - GitHub

## Next Steps

After completing Level 2, I advanced to
**Level 3 – Algorithms & Problem Solving**,
which introduces more advanced challenges and concepts.
